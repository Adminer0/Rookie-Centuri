#**🖨️ Rookie Centuri
A Beginner-Friendly CoreXY 3D Printer**

Rookie Centuri is a compact CoreXY-based 3D printer designed to help beginners and students learn the working principles of modern 3D printers.

**📌 About the Project**

Rookie Centuri is inspired by the Rook MK1 and focuses on learning over size.
With a build volume of 110 × 110 × 110 mm, the printer is ideal for understanding CoreXY motion, calibration, and slicing without the complexity of large machines.

This project is meant for education, experimentation, and skill-building.

**🎯 Project Objective**

The main objectives of Rookie Centuri are to:

Teach the CoreXY motion system

Help users understand belt and motor coordination

Practice bed leveling and calibration

Learn slicer settings and print tuning

Build confidence before using larger printers

**🧠 Why Rookie Centuri?**

✅ Compact size for easy learning

✅ Faster prints with less filament waste

✅ Beginner-friendly troubleshooting

✅ Strong foundation for CoreXY understanding

✅ Ideal for school and STEM projects

Rookie Centuri focuses on building skills, not just parts.
